TCG 2022 Project 3 Judger & Utilities V20221101
The provided judger, nogo-judge, can only be executed in the Linux environment.
The provided scripts, run-gogui-*.sh, require bash, common commands, and some GoGui tools.
The tools extracted from GoGui (in gogui-1.4.9 folder) require Java runtime.
(If you need the complete GoGui package, please check the official GoGui website)

Before running the judger, make sure that the files remain executable:
$ chmod +x nogo-judge run-gogui-twogtp.sh run-gogui-server.sh

===========================================================================

Bash script "run-gogui-twogtp.sh" is for evaluating the win rates between two programs.

First, edit this file with a text editor.
At the beginning of this script, the commands of both sides are defined.
Replace P1B and P1W with your commands accordingly, remember to keep the ' quote marks.
> P1B='./nogo --shell --name="Hollow-Black" --black="mcts T=1000"'
> P1W='./nogo --shell --name="Hollow-White" --white="mcts T=1000"'

Note that P2B and P2W are already commands of the judger and can be used directly.
> P2B='./nogo-judge --shell --name="Judge-Weak-Black" --black="weak"'
> P2W='./nogo-judge --shell --name="Judge-Weak-White" --white="weak"'
The judger provides 4 levels: "random", "weak", "medium", and "strong".

Once the modification is done, save the file, and run the script as follows:
$ ./run-gogui-twogtp.sh 20 # play 20 games in total

Then, the monitor for displaying running games will be printed by the script.
You can use another terminal to launch the monitor (./gogui-twogtp-XXX.mon).

The results will be displayed once all games are finished.
Ths statistics and episodes of all games are saved in gogui-twogtp-* folder.

===========================================================================

To play with a remote program via internet, follow the instructions below.

At remote side:
First, edit the script "run-gogui-server.sh",
at line 3, replace the command with the command of the program to be launched.
> player='./nogo --shell --name="Hollow" --black="mcts T=1000" --white="mcts T=1000"'

Then, start the script as follows:
$ ./run-gogui-server.sh # you may specify a port for incoming connection

If two program instances are required, run two scripts with different commands.
Once the script successfully started, the hostname and the address will be displayed.
Note that if a port is already taken, the script will try the next port number.
Therefore, when multiple ports are displayed (Port: XXXXX), use the last one.

At local side:
Edit the script "run-gogui-twogtp.sh",
Uncomment line 10 and 11 and replace them with correct addresses and ports.
> #P2B="gogui-client tcglinux1 12345"
> #P2W="gogui-client tcglinux1 12345"

Replace the hostname and port number to those displayed at the remote side.
Finally, save the changes and launch the script.
